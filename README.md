## Description:
I created an application that retrieves weather data for cities using a Third-party API and Javascript. 

## First Look: 
![Weather Dashboard App](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69092983/105550978-b4699e00-5cc7-11eb-85a5-97b36030acdd.gif)

## Technologies Used: 
* [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Installation:
You will first need to create an ```Assets``` folder to store your js and css folders/files. Then you will obtain an API key from Open Weather in order to access weather data.
